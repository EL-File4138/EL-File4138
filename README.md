Nope, Just Stop Reading it.


I'm a 15-year old student in China. I think the Internet right now is terrible, nomatter where.

I'm currently working on **Practical Personal Privacy Technology and Usage** researching, collabrating with my team @HelloWorld-Hash-ZERONE, and some documentary/creative writing such as tech guide, ARG game script, novel and more.

As for my future plan, I'll gradually stop current activity under this id, disconnect with people who knows me, dispose the id, immigrate to a country where personal privacy and human rights matters, restart my digital life with a completely new id.

We'll meet at a free place.
